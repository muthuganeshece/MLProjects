Dataset Preparation:
- Sensor Configuration:
	- Dimension of each parameter: 10 X 2048
	- 140 to 220 degree
	- Extract only the respective pixel data
- Assume, 
	- Exp1: 18 Sep
	- Exp2: 20 Sep
	- Exp3: 20 Oct
	- Exp4: 08 Apr
- Exp1 to Exp3:
	- Ignore BG data as it is not consistent
	- Split the full file into 2 sections
		- Smoke Generation
			- Statistical calculation for 10 FPS
		- Smoke Degeneration
			- Statistical calculation for 1 FPS
		- Normalize all the values based on the average of first 50 samples from Smoke generation
		- Identify and count outliers
	- Target imputation
		- Apply cubic interpolation between all the samples with respect to time
	- Merge target imputation with feature data
- Exp4:
	- Normalisation value to be calculated from BG data as the smoke generation doesn't have initial data
	- 00: Smoke generation data, statistical measurement performed at 10FPS data
	- 01 - 10: Smoke degeneration data, statistical measurement performed at 1FPS data
	- Target imputation
		- Apply cubic interpolation between all the samples with respect to time
		- Extrapolate the samples for extra frames in lidar data

EDA:
- Insignificant parameters for model Refer to Data.xlsx
- Exp0/4:
	- Significant drop observed in IR reading for some samples
	- As IR is one of the significant features, the outlier need to be imputed with mean values

Model:
- Linear Regression
- polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Important Features:
Points Range
Mean Range
Points Reflectivity
Kurtosis IR
Mean Signal Photon
Skew IR




LIDAR system based Smoke concentration measurement for reactor building
In fast reactors, liquid metal sodium is used as coolant due to its high conductivity.
Liquid sodium exothermically reacts with air/water and generates invisible sodium aerosols which.
The concentration

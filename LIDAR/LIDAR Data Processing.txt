Dataset Preparation:
- Sensor Configuration:
	- Dimension of each parameter: 10 X 2048
	- 140 to 220 degree
	- Extract only the respective pixel data
- Assume, 
	- Exp1: 18 Sep
	- Exp2: 20 Sep
	- Exp3: 20 Oct
	- Exp4: 08 Apr
- Exp1 to Exp3:
	- Ignore BG data as it is not consistent
	- Split the full file into 2 sections
		- Smoke Generation
			- Statistical calculation for 10 FPS
		- Smoke Degeneration
			- Statistical calculation for 1 FPS
		- Normalize all the values based on the average of first 50 samples from Smoke generation
		- Identify and count outliers
	- Target imputation
		- Apply cubic interpolation between all the samples with respect to time
	- Merge target imputation with feature data
- Exp4:
	- Normalisation value to be calculated from BG data as the smoke generation doesn't have initial data
	- 00: Smoke generation data, statistical measurement performed at 10FPS data
	- 01 - 10: Smoke degeneration data, statistical measurement performed at 1FPS data
	- Target imputation
		- Apply cubic interpolation between all the samples with respect to time
		- Extrapolate the samples for extra frames in lidar data

EDA:
- Insignificant parameters for model Refer to Data.xlsx
- Exp0/4:
	- Significant drop observed in IR reading for some samples
	- As IR is one of the significant features, the outlier need to be imputed with mean values

Model:



LIDAR system based Smoke concentration measurement for reactor building
In fast reactors, liquid metal sodium is used as coolant due to its high conductivity.
Liquid sodium exothermically reacts with air/water and generates invisible sodium aerosols which.
The concentration
